<h1>Asking questions and reporting bugs in GNU Midnight
Commander</h1>
<p>This document gives some tips how to ask questions and report
bugs in the mailing lists for GNU Midnight Commander. This document
is intentionally terse, as it mostly deals with the issues specific
to the project and its development team. For more generic
instructions, please see the links at the end of this document.</p>
<p>Mention the version of GNU Midnight Commander. Don't assume that
you don't need it if you mentioned it before. People who can really
help you may not have time to check your old e-mails and even then
they don't know if you are talking of the same version. Don't
assume that the version of your OS or distribution is sufficient -
not everybody has time to investigate which version of GNU Midnight
Commander is included with your system.</p>
<p>To find out the version of GNU Midnight Commander, run <code>mc
--version</code> on the command line. You will see several strings
of output. If unsure, quote the whole output of the <code>mc
--version</code> command - it gives developers the idea not just of
the version, but also of the configuration of your copy of GNU
Midnight Commander.</p>
<p>Please note that the reports and questions not mentioning the
version of GNU Midnight Commander at all are very unlikely to get a
response that would be useful for you!</p>
<p>If you can easily upgrade to the latest released version of GNU
Midnight Commander, please do so and check if the problem persists.
Problems already fixed in the latest version are hardly interesting
to anybody.</p>
<p>Whenever the problem affects the keyboard input or the screen
output, mention what kind of terminal you are using (e.g. Linux
console, xterm or putty). Also report the value of the TERM
environment variable. You can find this value by running "echo
$TERM" is any shell.</p>
<p>When reporting a problem, make sure that three things are clear
from your message:</p>
<ol>
<li>what you do</li>
<li>what you get</li>
<li>what you expect to get</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two mailing lists for the project -
<tt>mc@gnome.org</tt> and <tt>mc-devel@gnome.org</tt>. The former
is for users, the later is for developers. If you are ready to
discuss how to fix the problem in the future versions, the
developers' list is preferred. Otherwise, use the list for users.
Do not post questions to both lists. Cross-posting is allowed only
for developers to make announcements.</p>
<p>Both mailing lists are archived. The links to the archives can
be found on the homepage of the project, <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/software/mc/">http://www.gnu.org/software/mc/</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the archives exist so that people can browse
them. You can do it too, to see if your question has been
answered.</p>
<p>Give informative subjects to your messages. Subjects like "one
thing" or "bug" don't give the readers the idea what your message
is about. People looking for messages about a particular topic will
likely miss your message or even the whole thread.</p>
<p>Don't send messages in HTML or in both text and HTML. Some mail
readers don't treat HTML in a safe way, so it's the responsibility
of the list maintainer to filter out HTML e-mail even if it's not
spam. If plain text is not sufficient to express your ideas, use
screenshots and attach them, or better yet, put them on your
website (if you have one) and send a link to the image.</p>
<p>Don't move discussion to private e-mail, unless there are
serious reasons (e.g. you discuss security problems that can be
exploited). Even simple questions and answers belong to the mailing
list, so that the subscribers and readers of the archives can see
the complete answer. Note that developers are likely to write
better replies for a wider audience.</p>
<p>Just because somebody answers you, it doesn't mean that you've
got a free consultant and that you can send 5 or 10 messages a day
to the mailing list. At some point (usually when becomes obvious
that you don't do your own research), the person answering your
questions will stop, and other subscribers are unlikely to continue
answering your questions.</p>
<p>The above text mostly covers issues particularly relevant to the
GNU Midnight Commander. There are more detailed documents
applicable to other projects as well. It is recommended that you
spend some time and read those documents. Your chances to get
useful answers will increase. You chances to be treated like an
annoyance will decrease. Those documents are worth every minute you
spend reading them.</p>
